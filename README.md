# Minesweeper
* Group Member: James Yoo (Solo)
* This PyQT project is a GUI for Minesweeper.

## Goals for the GUI
* On launch the GUI will have four widgets.
* The first three widgets from left to right will have difficulties for the game. 
* The right-most widget will explain the controls and how to play the game very breifly

## Goals for the Game
* Selecting a difficulty for the game will open a game on the right side of the GUI
* The game will start when clicking on a cell of the grid.
* Timer will update upon first click 
* User can left click to reveal cells
* User can right click to flag cells. 
* User can not reveal falgged cells (like standard minesweeper) unless the user unflags the flag (by right clicking the cell  with the flag again)
* If the user wins or loses the game, there will be a pop up alerting the user with a widget to close the window. Then the map 
will be completely revealed
*The user will have the choice to reset the game by clicking a the smiley-face, which is a widget to reset the game. The user can also 
select another difficulty for a new game

## Goals for the control
* Breifly describes the controls for the game 
* A button to return to the home screen
